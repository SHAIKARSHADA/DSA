// The skeleton of the C++ is 

// #include<iostream>
// #include is an thing that is including the Iostream library

// we can include multiple libraries like 
// #include<math.h> but, we include an singular library that all of the librarys it is a bit slow but, preferrable to use everywhere 
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std; 

// this is where you codes part gets to start from 
int main() {
  //in here we can use 
  int x, y;
  cin >> x >> y;
  // to store values we use cin and followed by the value and 
  cout << "The Value of x + y : " << x+y; 
  // to print something we use Cout and followed by the value 
  // In here we would be using the std::cin...., std::cout...., but, we are using something called namespace for this stuff.
